2. Petrol StationSimulate the process of refueling. Within the while loop ask user if you should continue or finish. For every entered "continue" command you should add a specific amount of petrol and money (both of type double) and view it on the console.
At the end user should pay for petrol. Consider multiple possibilities, like:
The user paid exactly as much as required.
The user paid too much (cashier should return the rest of the money).
The user paid too little â€“ should be asked for the rest.
